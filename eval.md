Very cool CLI! The presentation is very nice, and it's nice to see some Python in a project. Check my comments in main.py and 
setup.py for some places for improvement. 

49/50 

5/5 Ask the user questions about characteristics of their secret celebrity, and respond to the answers to improve guesses. (5 pts.)

5/5 Use a binary tree containing at least 20 guesses. (5 pts.)

9/10 Include a TreeNode deserialize(String s) method that takes a string of values representing a binary tree and constructs and returns the corresponding binary tree. (10 pts.)
    - deserialize should take a parameter for the file path.

10/10 Store with persistence the binary tree in a file called tree.txt in the project. Include a String serialize(TreeNode root) method to convert a tree into a string that represents it. (10 pts.)  

10/10 A GUI or CLI that is clear and easy to use. (10 pts.)
If you use a GUI, provide a button that opens a window containing documentation with a project description.
If you use a CLI, include documentation with a project description and available commands that can be accessed by typing --help or -h as a command line argument. See this reference for more information.

10/10 If a userâ€™s celebrity is not guessed (i.e., that celebrity is not stored in your application), ask them to name the celebrity. Store that name in a persistent file called nodestoadd.txt that can be used to improve the application. (10 pts.)
